aztest

Started with aztest - a test of course

Branching...

First addition is a C# project in the Directory Services area - I am NOT a software developer so my code is potentially quite raw in certain areas of the namespace/s, but as I am essentially an infrastructure/security engineer, it quite relentlessly always "does the job".



C# Directory Services project executed briefly and partially as senior systems engineer for major ariline, as consultant working for first IT provider in Asia-Pacific region.
